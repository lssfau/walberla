/*!
*   \brief Base class for all boundary classes
*
*   Every boundary class must be derived from this class and implement the following concept/member functions (for some
*   exemplary implementations look at classes NoSlip, FreeSlip, UBB, or SimpleUBB in module lbm/boundary):
*
*  1.  "static shared_ptr<BoundaryConfiguration> createConfiguration( const Config::BlockHandle & config )"
*      This function is used to extract parameters from a configuration file and pass them to the boundary condition.
*      Meaning: This function defines how the parameter specification for this boundary condition must look like in the
*      configuration file.
*      If your boundary condition is stateless/does not need parameters, you can implement this function as follows:
*         "{ return make_shared<BoundaryConfiguration>(); }"
*      If you do need to pass parameters, these parameters must be implemented in terms of a derived class of
*      "BoundaryConfiguration" (as an example, see class "UBB").
*  2.  "void pushFlags( std::vector< FlagUID >& uids )"
*      This function receives (by reference) a vector and must insert (using push_back!) all FlagUIDs into this vector
*      that mark cells as boundary cells that must be treated by this boundary condition.
*  3.  "void beforeBoundaryTreatment()"
*      This function is called once before the boundary handler starts the boundary treatment. Of course, this function
*      is called every time the boundary treatment of the boundary handler is triggered (normally once per time step).
*  4.  "void afterBoundaryTreatment()"
*      Just like "beforeBoundaryTreatment", this function is called once after the boundary handler has finished the
*      boundary treatment.
*  5.  "template< typename Buffer_T >
*       void packCell( Buffer_T & buffer, const cell_idx_t x, const cell_idx_t y, const cell_idx_t z )"
*      This function is called every time a boundary cell that is handled by this boundary class is serialized. If
*      the boundary condition stores additional parameters for the boundary cell (x,y,z) these parameters must be
*      serialized and stored in the buffer "buffer". [5) serializes and 6) deserializes, both functions must match]
*  6.  "template< typename Buffer_T >
*       void registerCell( Buffer_T & buffer,
*                          const flag_t flag, const cell_idx_t x, const cell_idx_t y, const cell_idx_t z )"
*      This function is called every time a boundary cell that is handled by this boundary class is deserialized. The
*      flag which was set (must be part of this->mask_!), the cell (x,y,z), and a buffer that potentially stores
*      parameters are passed. [5) serializes and 6) deserializes, both functions must match]
*  7.  "void registerCell( const flag_t flag, const cell_idx_t x, const cell_idx_t y, const cell_idx_t z,
*                          const BoundaryConfiguration & parameter )"
*      This function is called every time a boundary that is handled by this boundary class is set at the boundary
*      handler. The flag which was set (must be part of this->mask_!), the cell (x,y,z), and a corresponding parameter
*      are passed.
*  8.  "void registerCells( const flag_t flag, const CellInterval & cells, const BoundaryConfiguration & parameter )"
*      Just like "registerCell", only this function is called if a boundary that is handled by this boundary class is
*      set for each cell in a specific cell interval (-> "cells").
*  9.  "template< typename CellIterator >
*       void registerCells( const flag_t flag, const CellIterator & begin, const CellIterator & end,
*       const BoundaryConfiguration & parameter )"
*      Just like the previous two functions, only this function is called if multiple boundary cells that are handled
*      by this boundary class are set at the boundary handler using CellIterators (= iterators the dereference to type
*      "Cell" - examples: iterators of classes CellVector, CellSet, ...).
*  10. "void unregisterCell( const flag_t flag, const cell_idx_t x, const cell_idx_t y, const cell_idx_t z )"
*      This function is called every time a boundary that is handled by this boundary class is removed at the boundary
*      handler. The flag which was removed (must be part of this->mask_!) and the corresponding cell (x,y,z) are passed.
*  11. "void treatDirection( const cell_idx_t  x, const cell_idx_t  y, const cell_idx_t  z, const stencil::Direction dir,
*                            const cell_idx_t nx, const cell_idx_t ny, const cell_idx_t nz, const flag_t mask )"
*      This function is called during boundary treatment, the parameters that are passed are as follows:
*      Coming from cell (x,y,z) and going in direction "dir" the cell (nx,ny,nz) was reached. Cell (nx,ny,nz) is a
*      boundary cell that is handled by this boundary class. All the flags that are currently set at cell (nx,ny,nz) in
*      the flag field are passed via "mask".
*  12. If the treatDirection member function is thread-safe, i.e., if this function can be called in parallel for
*      different input parameters, you have to add the following constant static boolean member variable to your class:
*      "static const bool threadsafe = true;"
*
*   Every boundary class must call the constructor of "Boundary" which expects a BoundaryUID (all boundary conditions
*   registered at the same boundary handler must have unique boundary UIDs).
*
