# Prefabs

```{eval-rst}
.. module:: sweepgen.prefabs
```

The SweepGen Prefab library (`sweepgen.prefabs`) hosts a collection of generators
for *pre-fabricated* sweeps and sweep groups.
They encapsulate reusable algorithmic patterns which have been found to often occur
across a range of applications and scenarios.
