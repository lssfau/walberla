This example appplication simulates the flow behavior around a spherical obstacle
in a channel.

## Code Generation

The numerical kernels involved in the application are generated by the script FlowAroundSphereExample.py:

\include FlowAroundSphere/FlowAroundSphereExample.py

## Application Frame

The simulation app itself is implemented in FlowAroundSphereExample.cpp:

\include FlowAroundSphere/FlowAroundSphereExample.cpp
