# Parallel Plates {#example-ParallelPlates}

\viewOnGitlab{apps/examples/ParallelPlates}

This example implements the Couette and Poiseuille laminar flow scenarios
between two infinite parallel plates.

## Code Generation

The numerical kernels for both scenarios are generated by ParallelPlatesSweeps.py.

\include ParallelPlates/ParallelPlatesSweeps.py

## Application Frame

The simulation app itself is implemented in ParallelPlates.cpp.

\include ParallelPlates/ParallelPlates.cpp
