\section further_info Further information

Not all features of the framework are covered in the tutorials.
To get further information have a look at the modules pages.

Also, the test cases provided in the tests directory are a good starting point for your own developments.
Additionally, there is a folder for full-fledged application codes to be found under <tt>apps/benchmarks</tt> where also codes of walBerla publications are found.
