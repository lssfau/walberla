# waLBerla

waLBerla (widely applicable Lattice Boltzmann from Erlangen) is a massively
parallel framework for multi physics applications. Besides its original
objective, Lattice Boltzmann solvers for hydrodynamics, it now contains
modules for other applications like Multigrid and rigid body dynamics
as well. Great emphasis is placed on the interoperability between the modules
in particular the fluid-particle coupling.
It scales from laptops to current and future supercomputers while maintaining
near-perfect efficiency.

See <https://www.walberla.net> for more information and a showcase of applications.

## Documentation and Tutorials

Documentation for the C++ framework is available in
[Doxygen](https://walberla.net/doxygen/index.html), while the Python interface
is documented in [Sphinx](https://walberla.net/sphinx/index.html).

## Getting started

The minimum requirements are a C++20-compliant compiler (e.g. GCC or Clang)
and the [CMake](https://www.cmake.org)
build system. Furthermore, you need an MPI library (like
[Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org)) if you want to make use of parallel
processing capabilities. All of these dependencies are typically available in
your operating system's package manager.

### CMake

The typical steps, assuming your are in the waLBerla source directory, are:

- `mkdir build; cd build` create a build directory and change into it
- `cmake ..` call CMake with the waLBerla source directory as an argument
- `make` build waLBerla

To specify a CMake option you need to use `-D(Option)=(Value)`. For example to set the C++ compiler one can use:
`cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`

To list and modify the CMake options the `ccmake` tool can be used. Just call `ccmake .` in your **build** directory to see and change the
CMake options and variables.

Some important CMake variables:

- `WALBERLA_BUILD_WITH_CODEGEN` Enable pystencils code generation"
- `Python_ROOT_DIR` Specify the directory of the `python` executable. e.g. `~/miniconda/bin/`
- `MPI_HOME` Specify the base directory of the MPI installation.
- `WALBERLA_BUILD_WITH_PYTHON` Support for embedding Python
- `WALBERLA_BUILD_WITH_CUDA` Enable CUDA support (not compatible with ROCm HIP support)
- `WALBERLA_BUILD_WITH_HIP` Enable ROCm HIP support (not compatible with CUDA support)

For a full list of CMake options see the [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) file or use `ccmake` as described above.

### Codegen and Python

To use the `lbmpy`/`pystencils` code generation please install the packages with e.g. `python -m pip install lbmpy` and specify the correct python
environment when calling CMake.

In previous versions of CMake one could use `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` or `PYTHON_ROOT_DIR` (all upper case) to specify the python executable or
the directory. This does **NOT** work anymore. Please use `Python_ROOT_DIR`.
